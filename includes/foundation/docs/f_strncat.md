## Function: `f_strncat`

`char *f_strncat(char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);`

**Description:**

This function appends at most `n` characters from the string `s2` to the end of the string `s1`. The resulting string is null-terminated.

**Parameters:**

- `s1`: Pointer to the destination string.
- `s2`: Pointer to the source string.
- `n`: Maximum number of characters to append.

**Returns:**

Pointer to the modified destination string (`s1`).

**Note:**

- If the length of `s1` is not large enough to accommodate the additional characters from `s2`, the behavior is undefined.
- The behavior is undefined if `s1` or `s2` is a null pointer.
- The behavior is undefined if `s1` and `s2` overlap.

**Example:**
```
char str1[20] = "Hello, "; 
char str2[] = "world!"; f_strncat(str1, str2, 6); printf("%s", str1);  // Output: "Hello, world"`

In the example above, the first 6 characters of `str2` ("world!") are appended to `str1`, 
resulting in the modified string "Hello, world".
